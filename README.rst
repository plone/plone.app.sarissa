About Sarissa
=============

Sarissa_ is an ECMAScript library acting as a cross-browser wrapper for native 
XML APIs. It offers various XML related goodies like Document instantiation, 
XML loading from URLs or strings, XSLT transformations, XPath queries etc and 
comes especially handy for people doing what is lately known as "AJAX"
development.
